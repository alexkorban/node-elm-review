The suppress command helps with fixing reported errors gradually.

This can be useful for instance when adding new rules that report many errors in
your project, instead of ignoring the rules on the files they currently report
errors for, or delaying enabling of the rule until all errors have been fixed.

    elm-review suppress
        Reviews your project and generates suppression files for the reported
        errors.

    --check-after-tests
        Checks whether there are uncommitted suppression files. They may get
        updated when running elm-review, which people can forget to commit
        before making a pull request. Running elm-review suppress with this flag
        at the end of your test suite makes sure these files stay up to date.
        This command does not cause your project to be reviewed though.

While suppression files exist for your project, running elm-review will behave
as usual but with these additional behaviors:
  - Suppressed errors won't be reported.
  - If there are outstanding errors for the ignored rules and files, the related
    suppressed errors will be reported until you reduce the number of errors
    back to the number in the JSON file. This is a good opportunity to fix more!
  - If no errors are being reported and there are less suppressed errors than
    before, suppression files will be updated automatically, in order to make
    sure no new errors get re-introduced unknowingly.

While you can run the suppress command to ignore newly reported errors, please
do so with moderation. The aim of the suppression system is to allow enabling
rules while there are errors remaining and to have these fixed incrementally,
not to make it easier to ignore errors.

When you wish to actively tackle the suppressed errors, you can run elm-review
(without the suppress subcommand) with its available flags, and you can use the
following additional flags to help you:

    --unsuppress
        Include suppressed errors in the error report for all rules.

    --unsuppress-rules <rule1,rule2,...>
        Include suppressed errors in the error report for the listed rules.
        Specify the rules by their name, and separate them by commas.
